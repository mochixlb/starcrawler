# Star Jedi Font

This directory contains the Star Jedi font files used in the application.

## Current Setup

The application uses `Starjedi.ttf` for the logo/title text. The font is configured in `app/globals.css` and applied via the `font-logo` Tailwind class.

## Additional Font Files

The following font files are present but not currently used:

- `StarJedi-DGRW.ttf` - Alternative Star Jedi variant
- `StarJediHollow-A4lL.ttf` - Hollow/outline variant
- `Starjhol.ttf` - Hollow variant

These can be used by updating the `@font-face` declaration in `app/globals.css` if needed.

**Note:** The font is free for personal use. For commercial use, please review the licensing terms.
